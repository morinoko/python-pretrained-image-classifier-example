# Demonstration of using and evaluating a pre-trained, Python-based image classifiers

This mini-project evaluates pre-trained image classifiers VGG, Resnet, and Alexnet using Python 3.

Running `sh run_models_batch.sh` will run all three classifier for the set of images in `pet_images/` and output results into textfiles named `vgg_pet-images.txt`, `resnet_pet-images.txt`, and `alexnet_uploaded-images.txt`.

You can see the results in this repo by navigating to the those textfiles in this repository.
